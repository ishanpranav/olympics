--    This view automatically joins the two tables based on `noc`, only shows
--    rows where a medal exists, and groups to count medals.

-- 4. Use the window function, `lag()`
--     Shows the height of every gold medalist for pole valut events, along with
--     the height of the gold medalist for that same pole value event in the
--     previous year.

select
